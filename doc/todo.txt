Things to be done
=================

This page consist of different things that need to be done.

Show stoppers
-------------

There are currently the following known problems in levitation-2, which
prohibit the use of the software in a productive environment.

Check the range of :mark commands
.................................

The file content for each page is currently written with a ``:mark`` command,
which is of type integer. The git-fastimport documentation nowhere states,
which is the valid range of this parameter. There is a risk, that this is a
32 bit signed integer, and can overroll with large wikis.

Nice to have
------------

Statistics
..........

During the import there should be a statistic, how many revisions per second
are imported (should go along with the line about the last imported page).

After the import, following parameters should be printed:

* used time
* revision count of all pages
* page count
* average reisions per page
* memory usage


Tests
.....

Currently there is not a single software test. There should be at least a test
to check if the created software can successfully import a sample dump file.

Somebody Else's Problem(TM)
---------------------------

The following things are out of the scope of this project:

* make a git frontend, which can be used by non-developers
* create an offline editor, desirably with merge support
* add a storage backend to the MediaWiki software to support git as "Database"
