How to use the resulting git repository
=======================================

Get a list of all pages
-----------------------

Since elevation creates a branch for each page, you need to ask git to
display the branches. This is done with ``git branch``.

Check out out a page
--------------------

You can check out a page by checking out the corresponding branch. To view the
"Linux" page, you run ``git checkout Linux``. Afterwards the newest revision of
the "Linux" page is in the current directory in a ``Linux`` called file.

Get the history of a page
-------------------------

Simple run ``git log «page»`` to get the log of this page.

Create a lightweight clone of a page
------------------------------------

To create a clone which consist only of a limited number of pages, you cant
use ``git clone «URL»``, since a regular clone contains a full copy of the
remote repo. To get local repo with some selected pages only, you need to run
the following receipe:

.. code-block:: sh

  # create the repo
  git init mywiki

  # change into the repo directory
  cd mywiki

  # create a link to the source repo, and also pass
  # the pages we are interested here
  git remote add origin «REMOTE URL» -t«page 1» -t«page 2»

  # retreive the pages
  git fetch

  # Now the local repository has the pages we are interested in,
  # without a full clone of the remote wiki.
