C Language
----------

Despite my preference for python I choose C as the language for this project
because it shall be suitable to import very large MediaWiki installations
(such as the German Wikipedia, which is about 1TB large). To support this
requirement, it is better to use C, since C gives more control about different
runtime details, like memory management.

String memory allocation
------------------------

The allocation of memory for all strings is done in ``dynstring.c``. All
strings are grow-only. This behavior minimizes the needed calls to ``malloc``,
since after a short period of time the strings are grown to their maximum size.
So the speed impact of ``malloc`` when it reassembles fragmented memory is
neglected.
