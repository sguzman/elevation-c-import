Usage of elevation
==================

General usage
-------------

Elevation is a command line program, which read the XML file and writes
a `git fast-import` stream to feed git.

.. code-block:: sh

  git init --bare wiki.git
  ./elevation dump.xml |GIT_DIR=wiki.git git fast-import --date-format=rfc2822

Handling on Windows
-------------------
Since the current output handling requires a case-sensitive file system, it is
at the current state impossible to use elevation on windows. The alternative to
write the output to stdout is also not available on windows, since windows
changes the newline characters there.

Special parameters
------------------

TO BE DONE

After the conversion
--------------------
After ``git fast-import`` is done, the repository contains a ``meta`` branch,
which contains some technical informations about the imported wiki, and an own
branch for each page. See the :doc:`design page <design>` for the
reasons.
