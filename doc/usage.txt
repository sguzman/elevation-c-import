Usage of elevation
==================

General usage
-------------

Elevation is a command line program, which read the XML file and writes
a `git fast-import` stream to feed git.

.. code-block:: sh

  $ ./elevation -o stream_%c.git dump.xml 
  $ for 
    GIT_DIR=wiki.git git fast-import --date-format=rfc2822

Handling on Windows
-------------------
Since the current output handling requires a case-sensitive file system, it is
at the current state impossible to use elevation on windows.

Special parameters
------------------

TO BE DONE

After the conversion
--------------------
After ``git fast-import`` is done, the repository contains a ``meta`` branch,
which contains some technical informations about the imported wiki, and an own
branch for each page. See the :doc:`design page <design>` for the
reasons.
